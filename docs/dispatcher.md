# Dispatcher

If you aren't quite sure what a dispatcher is, please
read this little snippit from the [Flux Docs](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#a-single-dispatcher).

>The dispatcher is the central hub that manages all data flow in a Flux
application. It is essentially a registry of callbacks into the stores and
has no real intelligence of its own â€” it is a simple mechanism for distributing
the actions to the stores. Each store registers itself and provides a callback.
When an action creator provides the dispatcher with a new action, all stores
in the application receive the action via the callbacks in the registry.

## How we handle and view the dispatcher

The dispatcher is the key to Flux. The FluxThis dispatcher is basically the same
as Facebook's dispatcher, only a little more locked down. For example, all
actions dispatched by the FluxThis dispatcher are deeply frozen with
`Object.freeze` to protect them from mutation in store handlers. Our dispatcher
also has a little bit extra to allow for rich
[debugging](/#/docs/debugging) to the Flux cycle.

Unless you're planning on extending our dispatcher, you won't ever need to
require it. Every FluxThis component knows about the dispatcher singleton
internally.

## Integrate our dispatcher with your existing app

If you're integrating FluxThis in to an existing project, you can
require our dispatcher instance at `fluxthis/src/distpatcherInstance.js` and
drop it in your code to replace your current dispatcher.

So, instead of using the stand flux dispatcher like so,

```javascript
var Dispatcher = require('flux').Dispatcher;
```

You would instead do

```javascript
var Dispatcher = require('fluxthis/src/distpatcherInstance.es6');
```

And that's it! You can start using our disptacher to get super sick
[debugging](/#/docs/debugging).

## Dispatcher.dispatch(Action)

When you wish to dispatch an action to your Flux application, you will
call this method, which has the same interface as the standard
Flux dispatcher implementation.

#### Action
- `{string} source` **optional** - Source of an action to be used by a store
- `{string} type` **required** - The type of the action.
- `{object} payload` **required** - The action payload consumed by listening stores
